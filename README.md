The Heart Disease Prediction Project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques by analyzing a dataset containing various health-related parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other key indicators. The project includes steps like data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). After evaluating these models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, Logistic Regression emerged as the best performer with an accuracy of 89%, outperforming the other models. The project emphasizes selecting the best model based on comprehensive evaluation criteria to predict the risk of heart disease effectively.
